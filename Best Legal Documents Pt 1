THE GREAT STUDENT LOAN DEBT SCAM
...And How to IMMEDIATELY and Legally OPT OUT (full info attached)
*WORKS FOR ALL BANK LOANS*

(PART A: BACKGROUND)

Student Loan debt is now $1.5 TRILLION, an increase in over $250 Million PER DAY over the past DECADE!:
“Students who acquire large debts putting themselves through school are unlikely to think about changing society. When you trap people in a system of debt they can't afford the time to think. Tuition fee increases are a disciplinary technique, and by the time students graduate, they are not only loaded with debt, but have also internalized the disciplinary culture. This makes them efficient components of the consumer economy.” -Noam Chomsky (MIT Professor; World Speaker)

"Bank of America to Pay $16.65 Billion in Historic Justice Department Settlement for Financial Fraud Leading up to and During the Financial Crisis” -Department of Justice (August 21, 2014 Headline); Office of Public Affairs (Note: this is just one of many tens of thousands of cases they've been caught for defrauding America of ultimately Trillions, nearly 100% un-reported by our domestic enemy  ‘mainstream media’. The hundreds of Billions they’ve paid for fraud is tiny by comparison, and almost never trickles down to the real working-class victims. The GAO investigation revealed that the FED gave $16.1 TRILLION in secret loans during the financial crash; see citations for more info)

Morpheus: “The Matrix is everywhere; it is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.”
Neo: “What truth?”
Morpheus: “That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind...”

The Simple Story of Those Who Bankrupted Your World, and Demanded You Spend Your Life Paying Them For It (in Two Sentences):

Let’s pretend the mafia figured out how to put money into copy machines and make counterfeit bills. Then they loaned money to everyone and told them they just had to pay the mafia back twice as much over time or they’d attack and harass them, steal their remaining money or take their actual property. That’s the past century of the United States, since the Federal Reserve, in a nutshell.Except (to be fair)the group had no code of honor (even the mafia did; “no women, no children,” etc.) and used their unlimited buying power to systematically bribe and take over the vast majority of your Government, your school system, your media, the legal system, take over private business through Government-sanctioned monopoly methods, etc., so that most people now only learn, buy and do what they want you to.

Ron Paul (on the Federal Reserve): “It's illegal, and what we've given to this so-called 'agency' is the authority to counterfeit money... They just enter something on a computer- 'OH, you need $20 BILLION today?! Here's$20 BILLION!’-but they got that out of thin air. It came out of THIN AIR! It goes to the Treasury; the Treasury then pays the bills." (see citation; that’s the equivalent of 1 year of work for 700,000 Americans BEFORE they have to pay giant fake mortgage and other loan debt, and income tax (The Income Tax and the FED began in 1913 to 'pay off the National Debt' despite both being explicitly illegal under US Constitution; 16 years later the FED caused the GREAT DEPRESSION via stock market crash and an instant cease in cash-flow to the banks; and today the National Debt is over 5,000 TIMES what it was then not including interest)

“The Government bailed out the people and imprisoned the banksters- the opposite of what America and the rest of Europe did.” -Iceland President Olaf Grimmson (on how his country recovered so quickly from the recession)

(PART B: LEGAL DOCUMENT)

FROM:  __________________   Account Number (Optional):  __________________

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN at  _______________________  (AND/OR ALLEGED STUDENT LOAN DEBT OWNER)

Dear collection agent or company affiliate, I have been notified of a claim that I owe $ _______.___ for an alleged Student Loan (or other Bank Loan) debt (excluding all future interest and fees). I am giving you formal notice of the following (below). We wish you the best, and we thank you for your anticipated understanding and due diligence:

    Establishing Correspondence Framework and Conditional Acceptance:

a) I retain all my rights and waive none of them, and I consent to nothing. Note: (General) can protect transactions against any of the various ‘implied consent’ and ‘rights not stated are waived’ claims when filing documents
b) I am not aware of having made any contracts with you in the past, and do not wish to do so in the future, and nothing in/of this letter or any future communication may be construed as an attempt to enter into a contract.
c) I agree to pay anything I legally and rightfully owe, when I am able, providing I am given complete proof. Note: this is called “Conditional Acceptance” and now they’ll have nothing legally actionable; they cannot claim that you are refusing anything
d) Please limit all communication with me to writing only. If you do contact me via telephone, you are consenting to being recorded.Lobbyists have had laws passed claiming that you are legally required to notify collection agents before you record a call (so they know to limit the lies)
Note: your ‘debt’ is often not even stilled owned by the group requesting it (they can almost never provide the contract because it’s sold internationally- China incidentally owns many of them); you have EVERY RIGHT to simply request proof before further payment; AND due to the bank-criminal-induced recession, even if the debt was not fake (see below) you have the moral obligation to your family to temporarily cease payment.

    If I owe you anything as you claim, please provide complete verification/proof as follows:

a) An original contractual agreement signed by me, showing that I knowingly consented to transaction with original creditor. [Note: The original signed document alone does NOT verify the debt (it could have been wholly or partially paid back, signature could be forgery, contract could be non-binding, etc.)]; "The contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt."-Spears v. Brennan, 745 N.E.2d 862 (Ind.App. 2001) Note: under Federal Law and the FDCPA absolutely ANY group or institution requesting payment is required to provide FULL proof of their ownership of the debt (OBVIOUSLY, or they are quite laughably claiming Dictatorial power in the US), and then must take you through fair court procedure before they can forcibly take a penny UNLESS they perceive that you’ll just roll over like most of their poor victims do.
b) The Original LEDGER ACCOUNTING from Day 1 to the current (Where did all the funds go? How were the payments made? How were they credited?); "It is unfair to consumers under the FDCPA to hide the true character of the debt, thereby impairing their ability to knowledgeably assess the validity of the debt. One simple way to comply with § 1692e and § 1692f in this regard would be to itemize the various charges that comprise the total amount of the debt.”- Fields vs. Wilber Law Firm, 383 F.3d 562 (7th Cir. 2004)
c)Validation must come from the original creditor. - Wollman Letter (Federal Trade Commission); etc.
d) An original bill or invoice for the total amount claimed by you.Note: you don’t usually have to cite the actual law (they are required to know); you can even play dumb (as Mirraz recommends) and let them rack up offenses and sue them for the full amt.
e) The name of a living man or woman of real substance (computer-generated data sheets are NOT witnesses) who is willing to attest to these facts (verifying the validity of the debt) by way of an Affidavit of Truth, and who is willing to take full commercial liability should his/her claims prove to be unfounded, false and fraudulent.
f) Evidence that the original contractual agreement was legitimate and binding [i.e., made in good faith (not an attempted fraud, an issue I will cover below), full disclosure of all essential and relevant facts, a “meeting of the minds” (entails conscious understanding), etc.], while I may provide evidence to the contrary (see ‘j’ also).
